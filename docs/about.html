	<h1>About SPC for COVID-19</h1>
	<p>
		The genesis of this page is described on <a
			href="http://motorcycleguy.blogspot.com/2020/03/playing-with-control-charts-for-covid19.html">my
			blog.</a> I was trying to create a way to visualize how the infection
		rates were changing, and how I could tell if there was a change in on
		direction or another to either be worried about, or happy about.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cynthia-cindy-bush-584bb0158/">Cindy
			Bush</a>, a former colleague now working at what she called her "dream
		job" at CDC recalled Statistical Process Control charts to me more
		than a year ago as we were trying to figure out what we should be
		doing with telemetry data.
	</p>
	<p>
		I spent some time figuring out how to take data from various sources
		that I had access to, which resulted in me spending a lot of time in
		Excel. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54XLXg4fYsc">video</a>
		by Henry Reich over at minutephysics on You Tube made me rethink my
		math just a little bit, and after a few modifications, I came to a
		slightly modified way of computing my formulas. Kudos also to Aatish
		Bhatia who created the <a href="https://aatishb.com/covidtrends/">
			excellent visiualization</a> in that video.
	</p>
	<p>
		I hate manual data entry processes, especially when they get in the
		way of front line health workers, so when I found an <a
			href="https://covidtracking.com">online source</a> I decided to put
		it together with what I previously described as a <a
			href="https://gist.github.com/rooch84/f22ef52d53e1a593f2e0135fc4a44e99">gem
			of a gist</a> on github by a fellow named <a
			href="https://www.rooch.net/about-me/">Chris Rooney</a>, a PhD
		specializing in visualization out of Leeds.
	</p>
	<p>
		That's how this all started. It's up to someone else to take it
		further, as there is another <a
			href="https://github.com/AudaciousInquiry/saner-ig/wiki/About-The-SANER-Project">project
			keeping me sane</a> that I'm working on.
